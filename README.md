# DELICIOUSTUMBLE

A nostalgic homage to Delicious and StumbleUpon.

### Work in Progress: 

1. Bookmarking (Delicious-style):
Users can:
Add a URL.
Assign tags (e.g., “Tech,” “Recipes”).
View their saved bookmarks in a list.

2. Stumbling (StumbleUpon-style):
A button labeled "Stumble!" randomly selects a bookmark saved by any user and redirects to that page.
Users can stumble based on:
Specific tags.
Completely random selection.
